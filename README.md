## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Inside of your Astro project, you'll see the following folders and files:

```
/
â”œâ”€â”€ public/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ fonts
|   |   â””â”€â”€ images
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ favicon.ico
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ home/
|   |   â””â”€â”€ general/
|   |       â”œâ”€â”€ Header.astro
|   |       â”œâ”€â”€ Footer.astro
|   |       â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layouts/
â”‚   |   |â”€â”€ Layout.astro
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ ...
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pages/
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ peojects.astro
â”‚   |   â”œâ”€â”€ index.astro
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ styles/
â”‚   |   |â”€â”€ custom-styles.css
â”‚   |   |â”€â”€ fonts.css
â”‚   |   â””â”€â”€ styles.css
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json
â””â”€â”€ ...
```

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/assets` directory.

Your personal data would be go on `src/data` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                | Action                                           |

| `npm install`          | Installs dependencies                            |
| `npm run dev`          | Starts local dev server at `localhost:3000`      |
| `npm run build`        | Build your production site to `./dist/`          |
| `npm run preview`      | Preview your build locally, before deploying     |
| `npm run astro ...`    | Run CLI commands like `astro add`, `astro check` |
