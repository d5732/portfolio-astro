# Deployed to: https://denwa-dev.vercel.app/

## Getting started

Run the following commands:

```
brew install nvm
nvm use
npm install
npm start
```

## Structure

Astro looks for `.astro` or `.md` files in the `src/pages/` directory. Each page is exposed as a route based on its file name.

There's nothing special about `src/components/`, but that's where we like to put any Astro/React/Vue/Svelte/Preact components.

Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the `public/assets` directory.

External strings are in `src/data` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
