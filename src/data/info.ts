    summary:
        "I'm a full-stack developer based in Naperville, Illinois. With 4 years of software development experience and 16 years in IT, I can readily excel in any environment. My diverse background spans multinational corporations like Tesla and E. & J. Gallo, as well as start-ups and freelancing. I've resolved numerous complex problems, prioritizing scalability and client experience. Most recently, I created future-proof solutions for process automation at Martial Arts Technologies, using Node.js and Express.js, circumventing hundreds of hours of labor. I'm dedicated to continuous growth and am constantly looking for fresh obstacles to overcome.",
    about: [
        "I've developed software professionally for the past 4 years, and have more than 16 years of IT experience overall. I've been privileged to work with some awesome companies like Tesla, E. & J. Gallo Winery, as well as some really cool startups.",
        "Growing up in the Chicago area, my family owned and operated one of the largest suppliers of Camaro parts in the United States, which gave me early insight into the intersection of business and technology.",
        "In 2019, I landed a position developing website widgets for a software as a service company. There, I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create reusable components. I also automated processes related to data entry and report compilation using Python.",
        "Since 2021, I have been freelancing as an Agile full-stack developer, mostly using the PERN stack. I fell in love with the challenges of discovering requirements and delivering software rapidly keeping overhead low and negotiating the unexpected. Throughout that time, I have completed various certifications and educational programs to learn additional frameworks, and design patterns,",
        "While I do focus a lot on tech, I'm also a well rounded person. I play guitar and drums, and I volunteer as an ESL teacher through an international language exchange platform. When I'm not working I'm usually spending time with my family and with my pets.",
