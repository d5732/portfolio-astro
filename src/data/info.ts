  about: [
    `I've built software professionally for the past ${yearsOfSoftwareEngineeringExperience} years, and have more than ${yearsOfInformationTechnologyExperience} years of Information Technology experience overall. I've been privileged to work with some awesome companies like Tesla, E. & J. Gallo Winery, as well as some really cool startups.`,
    "Growing up in the Chicago area, my family owned and operated one of the largest suppliers of Camaro parts in the United States, which gave me early insight into the intersection of business and technology.",
    "In 2019, I landed a position developing website widgets for a software as a service company. There, I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create a component library. I also automated processes related to data entry and report compilation using Python.",
    "Starting in 2021, I shifted into freelancing as a full-stack developer, mostly using the PERN stack to build web apps. I fell in love with the challenges of discovering requirements and delivering software rapidly keeping overhead low and negotiating the unexpected. Throughout that time, I have completed various certifications and educational programs to learn additional frameworks, and design patterns,",
    "Currently, I'm building configurable microfrontend frameworks and improving system reliability for Tempus AI's DNA sequencing pipeline.",
    "Before my start as a professional software engineer, I enjoyed making automation tools with AutoHotKey and AutoIt, playing around with virtual machines to run old applications, and building websites. I'm grateful I was able to turn my passion into a rewarding career.",
    "While I do focus a lot on tech, I'm also a well rounded person. I play guitar and drums, and I volunteer as an ESL teacher through an international language exchange platform. When I'm not working I'm usually spending time with my family and with my pets.",
