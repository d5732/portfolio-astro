        "Growing up in the Chicago area, my family owned and operated one of the largest suppliers of Camaro parts in the United States, which gave me early insight into the intersection of business and technology.",
        "In 2019, I landed a position developing website widgets for a software as a service company. There, I used JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap to create reusable components. I also automated processes related to data entry and report compilation using Python.",
        "Since 2021, I have been freelancing as an Agile full-stack developer, mostly using the PERN stack. I fell in love with the challenges of discovering requirements and delivering software rapidly keeping overhead low and negotiating the unexpected. Throughout that time, I've have completed various certifications and educational programs to learn additional frameworks, and design patterns, ",
